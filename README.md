polymorphic_code
================

The code should be encrypted and stored inside a string. The file, when running will decrypt the string and using eval will put the code into memory, accessible by the program

 if you want to add you own code: 
 1 - write your ruby code. 
 
 2 - Copy the gn(code) function into a new file
 
 3 - copy your code and send it by parameter to gn
 
 4 - Print the output of gn
 
 5 - Put the output of gn into the variable code
